# How to run cfbot locally

## Setup database and config

```bash
cp cfbot_config.py.example cfbot_config.py
createdb cfbot
createuser cfbot
psql -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f create.sql "dbname=cfbot"
```

## Setup python dependencies

If you want to install them globally:
```
pip install --user -r requirements.txt
```

If that doesn't work for some reason or you prefer to scope these dependencies
to the project, you can instead use a virtual env:

```bash
# create a virtual environment (only needed once)
python3 -m venv env

# activate the environment. You will need to activate this environment in
# your shell every time you want to run the tests. (so it's needed once per
# shell).
source env/bin/activate

# Install the dependencies (only needed once, or whenever extra dependencies
# get added to requirements.txt)
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
